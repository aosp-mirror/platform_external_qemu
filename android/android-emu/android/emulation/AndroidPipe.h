// AndroidPipe is a mostly-abstract base class for Android pipe connections.
// It's important to understand that most pipe operations (onGuestXXX methods)
// are performed with the global VM lock held.
//
// - QEMU1 runs all CPU-related operations and all timers/io events on its
//   main loop. This will be referred as the 'device thread' here.
//
// - QEMU2 has dedicated CPU threads to run guest read/write operations and
//   a different main-loop thread to run timers, check for pending host I/O.
//   It uses a global lock that is held every time virtual device operations
//   are performed. The 'device thread' is whichever CPU thread is holding
//   the lock.
//
// IMPORTANT: Most AndroidPipe methods must be called from a thread that holds
// the global VM state lock (i.e. where VmLock::isLockedBySelf() is true).
// Failure to do so will result in incorrect results, and panics in debug
// builds.
//
// A few methods can be called from any thread though, see signalWake() and
// closeFromHost().
//
// Usage is the following:
//
// 1) At emulation setup time (i.e. before the VM runs), call
//    AndroidPipe::initThreading() from the main loop thread and pass an
//    appropriate VmLock instance.
//
// 2) For each supported pipe service, create a new AndroidPipe::Service
//    instance, and register it globally by calling AndroidPipe::Service::add().
//    This can happen before 1) and in different threads.
//
// 3) Once the VM starts, whenever a guest wants to connect to a specific
//    named service, its instance's 'create' method will be called from the
//    device thread. Alternatively, when resuming from a snapshot, the 'load'
//    method will be called iff 'canLoad()' is overloaded to return true.
//
// 4) During pipe operations, onGuestXXX() methods will be called from the
//    device thread to operate on the pipe.
//
// 5) The signalWake() and closeFromHost() pipe methods can be called from
//    any thread to signal i/o events, or ask for the pipe closure.
//
