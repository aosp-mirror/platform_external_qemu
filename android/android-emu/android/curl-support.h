// CURL library wrapper. This is used to perform the following:
//
// - Initialization and deinitialization of the library, in a multi-threaded
//   context.
// - Download data from a given URL, passing optional POST data to the server.
//
// It is important to avoid exposing <curl/curl.h> to client code, as this
// requires dragging the CURL-specific compiler flags to the client code
// otherwise.

// Initialize CURL library. |ca_info| is an option SSL Certificate Authority
// bundle. Return true on success, false otherwise. NOTE: not thread-safe.

// |ca_info| parameter that was passed to curl_init() to the returned CURL
// instance. Note that this function returns a generic pointer that must be
// cast to CURL* by the caller. This is because we don't want to include
// <curl/curl.h> from this header, since it would drag this dependency
// into any client code that includes it, most of them don't need it.

// properly compile on Windows).
