/* NOTE: On Windows, we make certain assumptions about * how many threads
 * are accessing * the camera capture API at a time:
 *
 * Namely, that only ONE camera thread is accessing the camera capture API
 * at any time.
 *
 * More details:
 *
 * First, some background. The windows camera capture library (vfw32)
 * cannot be operated on from multiple threads,
 * or stranges freezes/crashes will result.
 *
 * Therefore, all vfw32 calls will go through a single thread,
 * and the CameraDevice API on windows
 * merely sets arguments and signals that thread.
 *
 * The state machine running on that thread
 * then assumes that only one other thread is interacting
 * with it at a time. This is because
 * we assume the existence of only one camera client,
 * which results in only serial access to the underlying
 * camera API.

 *    can be NULL, in which case '/dev/video0' will be used as device name on
 *    Linux, or 'AndroidEmulatorVC' on Windows.
 *  inp_channel - On Linux defines input channel to use when communicating with
 *    the camera driver. On Windows contains an index (up to 10) of the driver
 *    to use to communicate with the camera device.
 * Return:
 *  Initialized camera device descriptor on success, or NULL on failure.

 *  pixel_format - Defines pixel format for the captured frames. Must be one of
 *      the formats, supported by the camera device.
 *  width, height - Frame dimensions for the captured video frame. Must match
 *      dimensions supported by the camera for the pixel format defined by the

 * Return:
