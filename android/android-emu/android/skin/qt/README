BUILDING AND RUNNING A QT EMULATOR

===========
BUILDING QT
===========

If you don't have $AOSP/prebuilts/android-emulator-build/qt in your workspace,
run the following scripts first:

  android/scripts/download-sources.sh
  android/scripts/build-qt.sh

They will rebuild the Qt libraries from source and place them at the location
above.

=================
BUILDING EMULATOR
=================

By default the emulator still uses a SDL2-based UI backend, the Qt one
is still experimental but can be enabled with the --ui=qt command-line
option, as in:

  ./android/rebuild.sh --ui=qt <other-options>

Use 'objs/emulator <options>' as usual to start the emulator. The build
script takes care of copying the Qt shared libraries to the correct location,
and the top-level 'emulator' program modifies the runtime library search
path to be sure they are located and used by the emulation engine.

This option is also supported by package-release.sh, i.e.:

  ./android/scripts/package-release.sh --ui=qt <other-options>


=================
DEVELOPMENT
=================

The Android build system supports running the 'moc' tool and compiling
the corresponding sources automatically, using something like this in
sources.mk:

   ANDROID_SKIN_QT_MOC_SRC_FILES := \
       android/skin/qt/tool-window.h \
       android/skin/qt/emulator-window.h \

Note that the 'sources' here are really header files that will be processed
through 'moc'. The corresponding generated sources are compiled into the
current module. The headers must be manually listed (i.e. there is no
automated scanning of all sources for Q_OBJECT macros).

The build system also supports running the 'rcc' tool to translate resource
files (*.qrc) into auto-generated C++ sources that are automatically compiled
into the current module (non-DYNAMIC version), or a separate .rcc file
(DYNAMIC version), with something like:

    ANDROID_SKIN_QT_RESOURCES := \
        android/skin/qt/static_resources.qrc
    ANDROID_SKIN_QT_DYNAMIC_RESOURCES := \
        android/skin/qt/resources.qrc

Note that the file's basename is used to invoke 'rcc' with the --name <name>
option.
