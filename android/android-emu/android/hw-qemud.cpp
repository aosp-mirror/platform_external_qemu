/*
 * IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
 *
 * We use one charpipe to connect the emulated serial port to the 'QemudSerial'
 * object. This object is used to receive data from the serial port, and
 * unframe messages (i.e. extract payload length + channel id from header,
 * then the payload itself), before sending them to a generic receiver.
 *
 * The QemudSerial object can also be used to send messages to the daemon
 * through the serial port (see qemud_serial_send())
 *
 * The multiplexer is connected to one or more 'service' objects.
 * are themselves connected through a charpipe to an emulated device or
 * control sub-module in the emulator.
 *
 *  tty <==charpipe==> QemudSerial ---> QemudMultiplexer ----> QemudClient

 * There is no QemudCharClient object because we can store a single
