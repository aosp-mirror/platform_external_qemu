# Android Emulator MacOS Development

This document describes how to get started with emulator development under MacOS. Throughout the emulator code base and documentation we ofter refer to MacOS as
[Darwin](https://www.howtogeek.com/295067/why-is-macos-software-sometimes-labeled-darwin/).

# Software Requirements

- You will need Xcode 10.1 or newer. Our official builds are using `Xcode 12.5.1 Build version 12E507`  with SDK version 11.3
- You will need MacOS10.13 SDK or later.

We have pinned the compiler and MacOS SDK on the build bots to make sure we do not encounter unexpected issues.

If you are using an M1 Mac, you can install a rust compiler toolchain to make sure you do not have to cross compile. You can
install rust, by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Getting Xcode

We use [xcode 10.1](https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_10.1/Xcode_10.1.xip) and encourage you to use the same version.

You can obtain Xcode here:

- If you are within Google:
  - Obtain [xcode](http://go/xcode).
  - Make sure to get the proper [santa exceptions](http://go/santaexception).
- From the [App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12), or
  use this direct link to get [xcode 10.1](https://download.developer.apple.com/Developer_Tools/Xcode_10.1/Xcode_10.1.xip).

Simply double-click the xip file and it will extract the Xcode application. Move Xcode to the `Applications` folder and you are good to go.

The next step is to to accept the license and install the command line tools.

    sudo xcodebuild -license accept &&
    sudo xcode-select --install

- _Note_: Xcode is usually installed in `/Applications/Xcode.app` you might run into unexpected issues if this is not the case.

You can validate that you have an Xcode version available by running:

```sh
xcodebuild -version
```

This should print your Xcode version.

You can obtain the installation directory as follows:

```
export XCODE_PATH=$(xcode-select -print-path 2>/dev/null)
echo $XCODE_PATH
```

Usually this prints `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`.

## Obtain MacOS10.13sdk:

The toolchain specifically looks for the MacOS 10.13 SDK, and will fail to configure if you
do not have it available. You can get the SDK here:

- If you are within Google, first install [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install), after which you can:

  ```sh
  gsutil cp gs://emu-dev-development/MacOSX10.13.sdk.tar.gz .
  ```

- Or get it from https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs (at your own risk)

And extract this to your install, for example:

```sh
export XCODE_PATH=$(xcode-select -print-path 2>/dev/null)
sudo tar xvf MacOSX10.13.sdk.tar.gz -C \
$XCODE_PATH/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs
```

## Obtaining repo

First we need to obtain the repo tool.

```sh
    mkdir $HOME/bin
    curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > $HOME/bin/repo
    chmod 700 $HOME/bin/repo
```

Make sure to add `$HOME/bin` to your path, if it is not already there.

```sh
 export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
```

Do not forget to add this to your `.bashrc` file or `.zshrc` if you use the z shell.

### Initialize the repository:

You can initialize repo as follows:

    mkdir -p $HOME/emu-master-dev && cd $HOME/emu-master-dev
    repo init -u https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest -b emu-master-dev

Sync the repo (and get some coffee, or a have a good nap.)

    repo sync -j 8

Congratulations! You have all the sources you need. Now run:

```sh
    cd external/qemu && android/rebuild.sh
```

If all goes well you should have a freshly build emulator in the `objs` directory:

```sh
 ./objs/emulator -list-avds
```

You can pass the flag `--help` to the rebuild script to get an idea of which options you can pass in.

### Incremental builds

The rebuild script does a complete clean build. You can use ninja to partial builds. The ninja build engine is part of our repository:

```sh
    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/emu-master-dev/prebuilts/ninja/darwin-x86/
    ninja -C objs
```

### Speeding up builds with 'ccache'

It is highly recommended to install the 'ccache' build tool on your development
machine(s). The Android emulator build scripts will probe for it and use it
if available, which can speed up incremental builds considerably.

```sh
    brew install ccache
```

#### Optional step

Configure ccache to use a different cache size with `ccache -M <max size>`. You can see a list of configuration options by calling ccache alone. \* The default ccache directory is ~/.ccache. You might want to symlink it to another directory (for example, when using FileVault for your home directory).

### Running builds from build bots

When you first download a zip file the build bots the system considers it to be foreign and tags it with a quarantine flag. This flag prevents it from running if it contains executable code.  This means you cannot run emulators that you obtain from the build bots.

If you run into this you can remove the quarantine tag as follows:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/my/unzipped/emulator
```


### Cross compiling to Windows with clang-cl

**_It is highly recommended to use a windows machine for windows development, vs cross compilation._**

It is possible to cross compile from MacOs to windows. This is mainly useful to quickly discover compilation issues, as you will not be able to actually run the code.

The windows target requires you to install the MSVC libraries. These libraries need manual intervention to be installed on your linux machine as you will need to:

1. Strongly consider not doing this, and develop on a windows machine.
2. You will need a case insensitive filesystem (you likely have this). See this [post](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/71357/how-to-check-if-my-hd-is-case-sensitive-or-not) to verify if yours is.
3. You will need the mingw toolchain (we use some program tools from mingw). The easiest way is to install it using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

   brew install mingw-w64

#### I'm within google

Make sure the `AOSP_DIR` variable has been properly set.

- You will have to obtain the windows
```sh
git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git /tmp/depot_tools
local DEPOT_TOOLS="/tmp/depot_tools"
# This is the hash of the msvc version we are using (VS 2019)
local MSVC_HASH="20d5f2553f"
export PATH=$PATH:$DEPOT_TOOLS/
download_from_google_storage --config
python3 $DEPOT_TOOLS/win_toolchain/get_toolchain_if_necessary.py --toolchain-dir=$AOSP_DIR/prebuilts/android-emulator-build/msvc --force --output-json=res.json $MSVC_HASH
ln -sf $AOSP_DIR/prebuilts/android-emulator-build/msvc/vs_files/${MSVC_HASH} $AOSP_DIR/prebuilts/android-emulator-build/msvc/win8sdk
```

next you will need to have a mingw compiler and realpath. The easiest way to obtain these is through homebrew:

```sh
brew install mingw-w64 coreutils
```

If all went well you can now target windows as follows:

    ./android/rebuild.sh --target windows-x86_64

#### I'm outside Google

1. You will need to have access to a Windows machine.

   - Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
   - Install [Chrome Depot Tools](https://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/depottools)
   - Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

2. Package your Windows SDK installation into a zip file by running the following on a Windows machine:

```sh
    cd path/to/depot_tools/win_toolchain
    # customize the Windows SDK version numbers
    python package_from_installed.py 2019 -w 10.0.19041.0
```

    copy the created zip file to your mac. Say win8sdk.zip

3. Execute the following on your mac:

```sh
    mkdir -p /mnt/msvc/win8sdk
    unzip win8sdk.zip -D /mnt/msvc/win8sdk
```

If all went well you can now target windows as follows:

    ./android/rebuild.sh --target windows-x86_64

### Sending patches

Here you can find details on [submitting patches](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo/+/refs/heads/master/SUBMITTING_PATCHES.md). No external configuation should be needed if you are within Google.
