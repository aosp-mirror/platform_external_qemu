# should connect to. The interpretation depends on the transport:
#   - TCP: The buffer contains the port number as a string. The server is
#     listening only on the loopback address.
#   - Win32 and UNIX named pipes: The buffer contains the full path clients
#     should connect to.

# A per-frame callback can be registered with setPostCallback(); to remove it
# pass NULL for both parameters. While a callback is registered, the renderer
# will call it just before each new frame is displayed, providing a copy of
# the framebuffer contents.
#
# The callback will be called from one of the renderer's threads, so will
# probably need synchronization on any data structures it modifies. The
# pixels buffer may be overwritten as soon as the callback returns; if it
# needs the pixels afterwards it must copy them.
#
# The pixels buffer is intentionally not const: the callback may modify the
# data without copying to another buffer if it wants, e.g. in-place RGBA to
# RGB conversion, or in-place y-inversion.
#
# Parameters are:
#   context        The pointer optionally provided when the callback was
#                  registered. The client can use this to pass whatever
#                  information it wants to the callback.
#   width, height  Dimensions of the image, in pixels. Rows are tightly
#                  packed; there is no inter-row padding.

#   format, type   Format and type GL enums, as used in glTexImage2D() or
#                  glReadPixels(), describing the pixel format.
#   pixels         The framebuffer image.

# In the first implementation, ydir is always -1 (bottom to top), format and
