/** FILE LOCKS SUPPORT
 **
 ** a FileLock is useful to prevent several emulator instances from using the same
 ** writable file (e.g. the userdata.img disk images).
 **
 ** Initialize the module by calling |filelock_init| from a single thread. Once
 ** initialized, this module is thread safe to use, but two threads can not
 ** safely lock the same path concurrently.
 **
 ** create a FileLock object with filelock_create(), the function will return
 ** NULL only if the corresponding path is already locked by another emulator
 ** or if the path is read-only.
 **
 ** note that 'path' can designate a non-existing path and that the lock creation
 ** function can detect stale file locks that can longer when the emulator
 ** crashes unexpectedly, and will happily clean them for you.
 **
 ** You can call filelock_release() to release a file lock explicitely. otherwise
 ** all file locks are automatically released when the program exits.
 ** It is safe to delete the originally locked file while the lock is held.
 **
 ** Note: filelock_release() doesn't free the memory used for FileLock object,
 **     it merely cleans up some extra buffers. This is needed to maintain a
 **     linked list of locks to be released in atexit() handler.
