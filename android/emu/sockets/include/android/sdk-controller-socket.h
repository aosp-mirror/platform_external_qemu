/*
 * Contains declaration of an API that encapsulates communication protocol with
 * SdkController running on an Android device.
 *
 * SdkController is used to provide:
 *
 * - Realistic sensor emulation.
 * - Multi-touch emulation.
 * - Open for other types of emulation.
 *
 * The idea behind this type of emulation is such that there is an actual
 * Android device that is connected via USB to the host running the emulator.
 * On the device there is an SdkController service running that enables
 * communication between an Android application that gathers information required
 * by the emulator, and transmits that info to the emulator.
 *
 * SdkController service on the device, and SDKCtlSocket API implemented here
 * implement the exchange protocol between an Android application, and emulation
 * engine running inside the emulator.
 *
 * In turn, the exchange protocol is implemented on top of asynchronous socket
 * communication (abstracted in AsyncSocket protocol implemented in
 * android/async-socket.*). It means that connection, and all data transfer
 * (both, in, and out) are completely asynchronous, and results of each operation
 * are reported through callbacks.
 *
 * Essentially, this entire API implements two types of protocols:
 *
 * - Connection protocol.
 * - Data exchange protocol.
 *
 * 1. Connection protocol.
 *
 * Connecting to SdkController service on the attached device can be broken down
 * into two phases:
 * - Connecting to a TCP socket.
 * - Sending a "handshake" query to the SdkController.
 *
 * 1.1. Connecting to the socket.
 *
 * TCP socket connection with SdkController is enabled by using adb port
 * forwarding. SdkController is always listening to a local abstract socket named
 * 'android.sdk.controller', so to enable connecting to it from the host, run
 *
 *   adb forward tcp:<port> localabstract: android.sdk.controller
 *
 * After that TCP socket for the requested port can be used to connect to
 * SdkController, and connecting to it is no different than connecting to any
 * socket server. Except for one thing: adb port forwarding is implemented in
 * such a way, that socket_connect will always succeed, even if there is no
 * server listening to that port on the other side of connection. Moreover,
 * even socked_send will succeed in this case, so the only way to ensure that
 * SdkController in deed is listening is to exchange a handshake with it:
 * Fortunatelly, an attempt to read from forwarded TCP port on condition that
 * there is no listener on the oher side will fail.
 *
 * 1.2. Handshake query.
 *
 * Handshake query is a special type of query that SDKCtlSocket sends to the
 * SdkController upon successful socket connection. This query served two
 * purposes:
 * - Informs the SdkController about host endianness. This information is
 *   important, because SdkController needs it in order to format its messages
 *   with proper endianness.
 * - Ensures that SdkController is in deed listening on the other side of the
 *   connected socket.
 *
 * Connection with SdkController is considered to be successfuly established when
 * SdkController responds to the handshake query, thus, completing the connection.
 *
 * 2. Data exchange protocol.
 *
 * As it was mentioned above, all data transfer in this API is completely
 * asynchronous, and result of each data transfer is reported via callbacks.
 * This also complicates destruction of data involved in exchange, since in an
 * asynchronous environment it's hard to control the lifespan of an object, its
 * owner, and who and when is responsible to free resources allocated for the
 * transfer. To address this issue, all the descriptors that this API operates
 * with are referenced on use / released after use, and get freed when reference
 * counter for them drops to zero, indicating that there is no component that is
 * interested in that particular descriptor.
 *
 * There are three types of data in the exchange protocol:
 * - A message - the simplest type of data that doesn't require any replies.
 * - A query - A message that require a reply, and
 * - A query reply - A message that delivers query reply.
