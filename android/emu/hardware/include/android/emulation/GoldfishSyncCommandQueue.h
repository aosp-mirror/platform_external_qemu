// GoldfishSyncCommandQueue ensures that commands sent to the Goldfish Sync
// virtual device take place in "device context"; that is, the commands
// are only executed while the main loop has the VM lock. Like PipeWaker
// of AndroidPipe, this class derives from DeviceContextRunner for this
// functionality.
// This class is only used for host->guest commands for goldfish sync device,
// and mainly timeline increment at that. The way to use
// GoldfishSyncCommandQueue in general is to call |hostSignal| with the
// particular details of the host->guest command being issued.
//
// However, make sure that |setQueueCommand| has been called on
// goldifish sync device initialization, which properly hooks up the
// GoldfishSyncCommandQueue with the particular virtual device function
// that actually raises IRQ's, and that |initThreading| has been called
// in a main loop context, preferably in qemu-setup.cpp.
