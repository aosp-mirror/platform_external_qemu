// This file defines common types for address space graphics and provides
// documentation.

// Address space graphics======================================================
//
// Basic idea
//
// Address space graphics (ASG) is a subdevice of the address space device that
// provides a way to run graphics commands and data with fewer VM exits by
// leveraging shared memory ring buffers.
//
// Each GL/Vk thread in the guest is associated with a context (asg_context).
// asg_context consists of pointers into the shared memory that view it as a
// collection of ring buffers and a common write buffer.
//
// Consumer concept
//
// ASG does not assume a particular rendering backend (though we will use
// RenderThread's). This is for ease of coding/testing and flexibility; the
// implementation is not coupled to emugl/libOpenglRender.
//
// Instead, there is the concept of a "Consumer" of ASG that will do something
// with the data arriving from the shared memory region, and possibly reply
// back to the guest. We register functions to construct and deconstruct
// Consumers as part of emulator init (setConsumer).
//
// Guest workflow
//
// 1. Open address space device
//
// 2. Create the graphics context as the subdevice
//
// 3. ping(ASG_GET_RING) to get the offset/size of the ring buffer admin. info
//
// 4. ping(ASG_GET_BUFFER) to get the offset/size of the shared transfer buffer.
//
// 5. ioctl(CLAIM_SHARED) and mmap on those two offset/size pairs to get a
// guest-side mapping.
//
// 6. call asg_context_create on the ring and buffer pointers to create the asg_context.
//
// 7. Now the guest and host share asg_context pts and can communicate.
//
// 8. But usually the guest will sometimes need to ping(ASG_NOTIFY_AVAILABLE)
// so that the host side (which is usually a separate thread that we don't want
// to spin too much) wakes up and processes data.

// During operation, the guest sends commands and data over the auxiliary
// buffer while using the |to_host| ring to communicate what parts of the auxiliary
// buffer is outstanding traffic needing to be consumed by the host.
// After a transfer completes to the host, the host may write back data.
// The guest then reads the results on the same auxiliary buffer
// while being notified of which parts to read via the |from_host| ring.
//
// The size of the auxiliary buffer and flush interval is defined by
// the following config.ini android_hw setting:
//
// 1) getConsoleAgents()->settings->hw()->hw_gltransport_asg_writeBufferSize
// 2) getConsoleAgents()->settings->hw()->hw_gltransport_asg_writeStepSize
//
// 1) the size for the auxiliary buffer
// 2) the step size over which commands are flushed to the host
//
// When transferring commands, command data is built up in writeStepSize
// chunks and flushed to the host when either writeStepSize is reached or
// the guest flushes explicitly.
//
// Command vs. Data Modes
//
// For command data larger than writeStepSize or when transferring data, we
// fall back to using a different mode where the entire auxiliary buffer is
// used to perform the transfer, |asg_writeBufferSize| steps at a time. The
// host is also notified of the total transport size.
//
// When writing back to the guest, it is assumed that the write buffer will
// be completely empty as the guest has already flushed and the host has
// already consumed all commands/data, and is writing back. In this case,
// the full auxiliary buffer is used at the same time for writing back to
// the guest.
//
// Larger / Shared transfers
//
// Each of |to_host| and |from_host| can contain elements of type 1, 2, or 3:
// Type 1: 8 bytes: 4 bytes offset, 4 bytes size. Relative to write buffer.

// size.
struct __attribute__((__packed__)) asg_type2_xfer {
    uint64_t physAddr;
    uint64_t size;
};
// Type 3: There is a large transfer of known size and the entire write buffer
// will be used to send it over.
//
// For type 1 transfers, we get the corresponding host virtual address by
// adding the offset to the beginning of the write buffer.  For type 2
// transfers, we need to calculate the guest physical address and then call
// addressspacecontrolops.gethostptr, which is slower since it goes through
// a data structure map of existing mappings.
//
// The rings never contain a mix of type 1 and 2 elements. For to_host,
// the guest initiates changes between type 1 and 2.
//
// The config fields:
//
struct asg_ring_config {
    // config[0]: size of the auxiliary buffer
    uint32_t buffer_size;

    // config[1]: flush interval for the auxiliary buffer
    uint32_t flush_interval;

    // the position of the interval in the auxiliary buffer
    // that the host has read so far
    uint32_t host_consumed_pos;

    // the start of the places the guest might write to next
    uint32_t guest_write_pos;

    // 1 if transfers are of type 1, 2 if transfers of type 2,
    // 3 if the overall transfer size is known and we are sending something large.

    // Set before setting config[2] to 3.
    uint32_t transfer_size;

    // error state
    uint32_t in_error;
};

// State/config changes may only occur if the ring is empty, or the state
// is transitioning to Error. That way, the host and guest have a chance to
// synchronize on the same state.
//
// Thus far we've established how commands and data are transferred
// to and from the host. Next, let's discuss how AddressSpaceGraphicsContext
// talks to the code that actually does something with the commands
// and sends data back.
