// thread on the host. Its main purpose is to send and receive wire protocol
// bytes in an asynchronous way (compatible with Android pipes).
//
// Usage is the following:
//    1) Get an instance pointer through a dedicated Renderer function
//       (e.g. RendererImpl::createRenderChannel()).
//
//    2) Call setEventCallback() to indicate which callback should be called
//       when the channel's state has changed due to a host thread event.
