// The FenceSync class wraps actual EGLSyncKHR objects
// and issues calls to eglCreateSyncKHR, eglClientWaitSyncKHR,
// and eglDestroySyncKHR.
//
// The purpose of this class:
// - We need to track EGL sync objects created by the guest and
//   realized in the host OpenGL driver. They are passed between
//   guest and host all the time.
// - In particular, we also need to destroy EGL sync objects at
//   the proper time. There are at least 3 issues (referenced below
//   in spec comments):
//   1 According to spec, we would need to allow concurrent
//     eglClientWaitSyncKHR and eglDestroySyncKHR to all finish
//     properly.
//   2 If the EGL sync object is of EGL_SYNC_NATIVE_FENCE_ANDROID
//     nature, we cannot mirror the guest's call to eglDestroySyncKHR
//     by calling the same function on the host, because Goldfish
//     sync device can only know when native fence FD's are signaled
//     when a host-side EGL sync object is signaled. Thus, we would
//     need to delete such sync objects after both the guest and
//     the Goldfish sync device are done with them.
//   3 We sometimes create sync objects that are only seen by
//     the Goldfish OpenGL driver in the guest, such as for
//     implementing eglSwapBuffers() in a way that avoids
//     out of order frames. It is cumbersome to eglDestroySyncKHR
//     those on the guest, as that would require starting up another guest
//     thread and OpenGL context (complete with host connection)
//     to destroy it.
