// SyncThread///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// The purpose of SyncThread is to track sync device timelines and give out +
// signal FD's that correspond to the completion of host-side GL fence commands.

// We communicate with the sync thread in 3 ways:
enum SyncThreadOpCode {
    // Nonblocking command to initialize sync thread's contents,
    // such as the EGL context for sync operations
    SYNC_THREAD_INIT = 0,
    // Nonblocking command to wait on a given FenceSync object
    // and timeline handle.
    // A fence FD object in the guest is signaled.
    SYNC_THREAD_WAIT = 1,
    // Blocking command to clean up and exit the sync thread.
    SYNC_THREAD_EXIT = 2

    // We use the wait() method to do a eglClientWaitSyncKHR.
    // After wait is over, the timeline will be incremented,
