# Vendorized Crates

This directory contains a set of symlinks to vendorized
crates that we have made available. In order to bring
in a new crate you:

- Must make sure it is available locally
- Must make sure it went through a proper security review

This can be accomplished by either:

- Using a crate from [AOSP](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/rust/crates/). These crates are missing `.cargo-checksum.json` files and cannot be used as direct depdendencies. Instead you will have to [patch](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html#the-patch-section) them in your workspace definition.

To use bindgen for AOSP you would add the following section to your workspace:

```rust
[patch.crates-io]
bindgen = { path = "../../../../../external/rust/crates/bindgen" }
```

- Using a crate from [chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/rust_crates/). These are a set of proper vendorized crates that have been reviewed. You make them available by creating a symlink in this directory.

## I want to bring in my own crate (**DON'T DO IT**)

If your crate dependency is not available in chrome or AOSP you will have to vendorize it yourself.

This means:

- You will own the crate (bugfixes, security fixes, etc..)
- You will have to get it reviewed, [see](https://g3doc.corp.google.com/company/thirdparty/android.md) for details.

Please try not to bring in any crates, as the maintenance cost can become high!
