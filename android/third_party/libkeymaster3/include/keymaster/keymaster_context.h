/**
 * KeymasterContext provides a singleton abstract interface that encapsulates various
 * environment-dependent elements of AndroidKeymaster.
 *
 * AndroidKeymaster runs in multiple contexts.  Primarily:
 *
 * - In a trusted execution environment (TEE) as a "secure hardware" implementation.  In this
 *   context keys are wrapped with an master key that never leaves the TEE, TEE-specific routines
 *   are used for random number generation, all AndroidKeymaster-enforced authorizations are
 *   considered hardware-enforced, and there's a bootloader-provided root of trust.
 *
 * - In the non-secure world as a software-only implementation.  In this context keys are not
 *   encrypted (though they are integrity-checked) because there is no place to securely store a
 *   key, OpenSSL is used for random number generation, no AndroidKeymaster-enforced authorizations
 *   are considered hardware enforced and the root of trust is a static string.
 *
 * - In the non-secure world as a hybrid implementation fronting a less-capable hardware
 *   implementation.  For example, a keymaster0 hardware implementation.  In this context keys are
 *   not encrypted by AndroidKeymaster, but some may be opaque blobs provided by the backing
 *   hardware, but blobs that lack the extended authorization lists of keymaster1.  In addition,
 *   keymaster0 lacks many features of keymaster1, including modes of operation related to the
 *   backing keymaster0 keys.  AndroidKeymaster must extend the blobs to add authorization lists,
 *   and must provide the missing operation mode implementations in software, which means that
 *   authorization lists are partially hardware-enforced (the bits that are enforced by the
 *   underlying keymaster0) and partially software-enforced (the rest). OpenSSL is used for number
 *   generation and the root of trust is a static string.
 *
 * More contexts are possible.
