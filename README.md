# Welcome to the Android Emulator

The Android Emulator allows you to test your Android apps on a variety of virtual devices and API levels without needing physical devices. It simulates almost all features of a real Android device, including phone calls, text messages, location, network speeds, sensors, and access to the Google Play Store.

## Getting Started

* Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and the required SDKs.
* Install the official emulator and create Android Virtual Devices (AVDs).
* Follow platform-specific instructions for Linux, Mac, or Windows:

  * [On Linux](android/docs/LINUX-DEV.md)
  * [On Mac](android/docs/DARWIN-DEV.md)
  * [On Windows](android/docs/WINDOWS-DEV.md)
